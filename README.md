# flask-rest-api-crud
ðŸ“– Project Description

This project is a User Management System with REST API developed using Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend. It is designed to demonstrate how REST APIs can be created in Flask and integrated with a simple yet interactive web interface.

The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data. The backend exposes RESTful endpoints, while the frontend interacts with these APIs using fetch() to display and manage data dynamically.

ðŸŒŸ Key Highlights

Implements CRUD functionality for user management

REST API built using Flask

Interactive HTML + CSS frontend with responsive design

Integration of JavaScript (fetch API) to communicate with backend

Clear separation of frontend (templates/static) and backend (Flask API)

Easily extendable to use databases like SQLite/MySQL instead of in-memory storage

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The objective of this project is to build a complete beginner-friendly Flask application that demonstrates:

How to design and implement REST APIs in Python (Flask)

How to connect backend APIs with a web-based frontend

How CRUD operations work in real-time with user interaction

How to structure a Flask project with templates and static assets

This project serves as a learning resource for students and beginners to understand REST APIs, frontend-backend integration, and web application development fundamentals.
